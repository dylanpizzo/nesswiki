# Ness Wiki

This is a wiki about Ness in SSBM. If you'd like to contribute, please join the [Nesscord](https://discord.gg/011MSaTVv85tRjQWO) and let us know you'd like to contribute.

Every markdown (`.md`) file in this repository will be visible at `meleeness.com/wiki/path-to-file`. For example, `yoyo-glitch.md` will be available at `meleeness.com/wiki/yoyo-glitch`. If you make a folder named `foo` and put a file named `bar.md` inside of it, you can see it at `meleeness.com/wiki/foo/bar`. The page `meleeness.com/wiki` gets it's content from `index.md`.

Here's a guide to [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). We specifically support [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) with an extension for wiki-style link syntax (that looks like `[[path-to-file|Text to Display]]`).

Currently images will not render if they are added to this repository. For the time being, if you want to include an image, you'll have to host the image elsewhere.

At the top of every markdown file, you can optionally include [frontmatter](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/using-yaml-frontmatter). This defines metadata about the page such as its `title` (the text appears in the browser tab), `description`, etc. Currently only those two fields are used, but more things might be functionally supported in the future.

It can sometimes take a few minutes for changes to show up on the actual site, so if you don't see your changes immediately after committing them, just wait like 5-10 mins and then refresh the page.

You can add and edit files through the GitHub website if you are uncomfortable using `git` in a command line or don't want to download GitHub Desktop and a text editor. To add a file, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository#adding-a-file-to-a-repository-on-github), or to edit a file, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-your-repository).
