# Ness Wiki

This is a wiki about Ness in SSBM. If you'd like to contribute, please join the [Nesscord](https://discord.gg/011MSaTVv85tRjQWO) and let us know you'd like to contribute.

Every markdown (`.md`) file in this repository will be visible at `meleeness.com/wiki/path-to-file`. For example, `yoyo-glitch.md` will be available at `meleeness.com/wiki/yoyo-glitch`. If you make a folder named `foo` and put a file named `bar.md` inside of it, you can see it at `meleeness.com/wiki/foo/bar`. The page `meleeness.com/wiki` gets it's content from `index.md`.

Here's a guide to [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). We specifically support [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) with an extension for wiki-style link syntax (that looks like `[[path-to-file|Text to Display]]`).

Currently images will not render if they are added to this repository. For the time being, if you want to include an image, you'll have to host the image elsewhere.
