# Dash Attack (PK Shove)

Ness has a very weird and overly complex dash attack. 

The most basic and common interaction is the simple 3 hit launch, which usually causes [Spooky Stun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceOwbGtPSUU&t=128s), which it's normally supposed to do; can lead to grab at low % or into short u-air strings. Keep in mind that it is a dash attack and like all dash attacks is very easily crouch cancelable.

Dash attack knockdown (DAK?) is a technique where when dash attacking close enough to someone that the third hit will miss and will leave the opponent in a knocked down and already jab reset state allowing for grab, f-smash, or other follow ups.

## Dash attack strong 1st hit properties

Ness's strong 1st hit dash attack has 2 different hit properties depending if you hit someone in the air or on the ground. If you hit them on the ground it works like expected and usually links into 2nd hit, but in the air it actually pops them up into the air again. This can help with combos while the opponent is in tumble from a previous hit.

## Dash attack push off stage/platform

When running against someone shielding near the edge of a platform or the stage you can push them off and put them into tumble and then get a launch knockdown from the first hit of DA. *This is not a shield poke*

## PK Shove 0% Gimp

If you dash attack someone at ledge and they DI downwards and slightly away it will send them at an awkward angle that will kill some fastfallers like Falco at 0% on Yoshi's. Otherwise usually you can ledgehog after doing this to still take the stock.

Some characters on some stages can easily make it back if not edgeguarded.
