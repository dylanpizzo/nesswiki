# Ness in other Versions

There are effectively four versions of melee:

- 1.0 NTSC
- 1.01 NTSC
- 1.02 NTSC
- PAL

The only differences to Ness that in versions 1.0 and 1.01:

- Opponents hit subsequently by the same PK Flash attack will experience the staled version of the attack
- PK Thunder stays active when Ness is hit

Also in the change from 1.01 to 1.02, is that attacks that deal less than 1% damage cause hitlag (they used to not). This is relevant for e.g. Smash DI-ability. The only move Ness has that does 1% is the tail of PK Thunder.
