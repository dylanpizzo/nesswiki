# Yo-Yo Glitch

## What It Is

The Yoyo Glitch (yyg for short) is a glitch that involves
dropping a lingering hitbox from either his up-smash or
down-smash yoyo attacks.

TODO: fill out this section, and improve everything about this page.

Once you've dropped the hitbox, there are several things you
can do with it.

## Follow-Ups

### Trapbox

The hitbox, lingering on the ground from the glitch is often
called a "trapbox". If an opponent walks into it, they will be
hit as if hit by the yoyo.

### Deadline

While the hitbox is on the ground, you can use an attack and
the hitbox of that attack will be stretched for the first frame
to be between where it normally would and where the trapbox is
lying on the ground.

### Jackets

You can use some attacks which can get cancelled in certain ways
to attach an active hitbox to your body. This can be done with:

- up air
- down air
- pk thunder 2
- some other more exotic things like being spit by kirby or being thrown

### Tombstone

If you die with a jacket equipped, the hitbox will remain at the location
you died until you respawn.

### Refresh

You can refresh the hitbox by doing another upsmash and hitting an opponent
with it or something.
