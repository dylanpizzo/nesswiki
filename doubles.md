# Ness in Doubles

Ness has some cool tactics he can use in doubles:

- If your teammate has an energy projectile, they can heal you through your [[psi-magnet|Psi Magnet]].
	- Fox may be especially good for this, since if you don't get the timing perfect, you're not stunned out of being able to start the Psi Magnet
	- 
- You can [[yyg|Yo-Yo Glitch]] off of your teammate, possibly even using down-smash.
