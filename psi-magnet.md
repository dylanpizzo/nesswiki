# Psi Magnet

Psi Magnet is Ness's down-b. It can be used to absorb energy projectiles and heal double the damage they would have dealt. It can also be used to stall, though that is not particularly useful in most situations.

Comprehensive(?) list of projectiles that can be absorbed:

- Dr. Mario pill
- Mario fireball
- Luigi fireball
- Bowser fire
- Yoshi down-b stars
- Falco laser
- Fox laser
- Ness [[pk-flash|PK Flash]], [[pk-fire|PK Fire]], and [[pk-thunder|PK Thunder]]

- Kirby up-b
- Samus charge shot
- Zelda din's fire
- Pichu thunder jolt (neutral-b), and thunder (down-b)
- Pikachu thunder jolt (neutral-b), and thunder (down-b)
