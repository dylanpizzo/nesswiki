# Psi Magnet

Psi Magnet is Ness's down-b. It can be used to absorb energy projectiles and heal double the damage they would have dealt. It can also be used to stall, though that is not particularly useful in most situations.

Comprehensive(?) list of projectiles that can be absorbed:

- Dr. Mario pill
- Mario fireball
- Luigi fireball
- Bowser fire
- Yoshi down-b stars
- Falco laser
- Fox laser
- Ness [[pk-flash|PK Flash]], [[pk-fire|PK Fire]], and [[pk-thunder|PK Thunder]]
- Ice Climbers ice blocks (neutral-b), and blizzard (down-b)
- Kirby up-b
- Samus charge shot
- Zelda din's fire
- Pichu thunder jolt (neutral-b), and thunder (down-b)
- Pikachu thunder jolt (neutral-b), and thunder (down-b)
- Mewtwo shadow ball
- Mr. Game and Watch bacon

Projectiles absorbed by magnet won't stale. Meaning two mario fireballs will heal a whopping 24% for example.

> I go for this vs Doc a lot when he pills during really high recoveries (think if he's like... comfortably above my FH range).
>
> My rule of thumb with Magnet vs Mewtwo, Doc, Mario, and ICs (maybe more, idk) is that if they did their projectile and then followed it up with something that commits them to a passive or defensive line of play, then you can probably absorb it safely. 
>
> So as an example, if Mewtwo SH shadow balls and then SH shadow balls again, it is ok to absorb the first shadow ball once we've confirmed that he's readied the second one. Similarly, if Doc ledgehop pills into edge regrab and then ledgehop pills again, once we confirm that he's not going onstage, that's when we know the first pill can be asborbed.
>
> What's not okay is when Doc ledgehop pills and then ledgedashes onto the stage, but we get excited to heal 16% so we put up our Magnet already. We need confirmation that the play he's doing after the pill limits his immediate mobility, or the 39f of absorption plus the Magent's natural release will make us punishable.

> What this also means is that the spacing for Magnet isn't so much about a specific distance so much as it's the amount of room you need to see the opponent projectile, confirm their next action, and then react & Magnet.
