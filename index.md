# Ness

Ness is currently ranked 23rd (4th worst) on the most recent (thirteenth) SSBM tier list, above only Zelda, Pichu, and Bowser. The best placement a Ness has gotten at a major tournament was 13th by Simna ibn Sind at EVO World 2007.

Ness is one of only four characters in the game with the ability to [[djc|Double Jump Cancel]] (DJC). The others being Peach who also has float, Yoshi who has double jump armor, and Mewtwo. His access to double jump cancel allows him to perform a technique known as [[psi-dash|Psi Dashing]].

Ness also has sole access to the [[yyg|Yo-Yo Glitch]].

His special moves include [[pk-flash|PK Flash]], [[pk-thunder|PK Thunder]], [[pk-fire|PK Fire]], and [[psi-magnet|Psi Magnet]]. His [[dash-attack|Dash Attack (PK Shove)]] is also very quirky.

Surprisingly, Ness is able to do fully invincible Hax Dashes, however, that is near impossible without notches or playing on a boxx controller.
